# StudentGradePrediction

 Machine Learning Project on Student grade Prediction

The project "Student grade prediction" is to work on an end-to-end case study to understand the different stages of Model building using the Machine Learning concept. This will deal with "data manipulation" with pandas and Numpy, and "data visualization" with Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries with the Student grade dataset. After Data manipulation and Data visualization, Exploratory data analysis to be performed on the Student grade and then a ML model to be built on the student grade dataset to create a model/system which can predict the grade according to the different attributes. Also to learn about the basics of the sci-kit-learn library to implement the machine learning algorithm.
